# dotcentral
This is my collection of dotfiles for linux machines. Included scripts will install the files as well as set up my shell environment on the target machine.

Highlights of this setup include the following:
* zsh / oh-my-zsh / p10k
* custom dircolors per [nord-dircolors](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-dircolors)
* laundry list of useful aliases
* handy scripts in .mirage

## Installation
To only copy dotfiles from a checkout into your home directory:
`./bootstrap.sh`

To perform a full installation:
`./shell-yeah.sh`

Note: To perform a full installation, you must either have sudo priveleges or have zsh already installed.
